# simple-node-db
A simple webpage build with Node.js and a database.

## This is not working
Normally you would handle the database stuff in the backend and call it from the frontend to ensure integrity and security. But my webhosting provider won't allow me direct SSH access to my webspace and thus I can't start any backend services. I tried some workarounds including shipping the db password in plain text, but obviously this is not working as it is a serious security flaw. Maybe it was dumb trying this long to access a database with frontend JS only, but hey: I learned a thing or twice. And you know what they say: "Learn one thing a day that scares you."
Let's see if I roll this project up again in the future.
